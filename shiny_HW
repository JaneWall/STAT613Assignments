Produce a shiny app that contains at least 3 different type of inputs including an action button of some sort.  
Output to the screen should include both a graph and some value computed by the code.  
Your app should be published to shinyapps.io and a link uploaded here along with your .Rmd file and a screenshot of your app running.  
In case you can't think of something to do, I am including a screenshot of a sample app that you can try to reproduce 
(perhaps without the facet ro and facet column inputs).  

Grade will be determined as follows:

1 pt each for 3 different input types

2 pts graph 

1 pt clickbutton works correctly

1 numeric computation results

2 code work and reacts to input changes

1 published on shinyapps.io

Extra credit possible if your shiny app is really shiny!!
